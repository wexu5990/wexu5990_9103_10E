Final project

The animation starts automatically without mouseclicking or refreshing

In my approach of the individual work, I am doing the part of employing timers and events for animation.

To enhance drawApples() function with animation using timers and events, I add setTimeout() into the function to animate the drawing of apples at different times, creating a sequence effect. 

I also add the animateBranches() by using setInterval() function to incrementally update the growthFactor and calls redraw() to refresh the drawing. This makes the branches appear to grow over time.
