Final project

The animation starts automatically without mouseclicking or refreshing

In my approach of the individual work, I am doing the part of employing timers and events for animation.

To enhance drawApples() function with animation using timers and events, I add setTimeout() into the function to animate the drawing of apples at different times, creating a sequence effect.
